Despite numerous studies addressing UHI mitigation strategies, the specific role of various environmental factors\u2014such as vegetation cover, water bodies, and urban surface materials\u2014on UHI intensity remains inadequately understood. This research investigates how these environmental elements influence UHI effects using a combination of remote sensing data and ground-based temperature measurements. We quantify the correlations between green space density, proximity to water, and surface material types with UHI intensity across several key urban regions. Our findings reveal that increased vegetation cover can lead to a 2-5\u00b0C reduction in surface temperatures during peak heat periods. Additionally, locations near water bodies demonstrate a significant cooling effect, with temperature differences averaging around 3\u00b0C compared to areas far from such features. We also identify that urban surfaces with high albedo properties contribute to mitigating UHI effects, showcasing potential strategies for urban planning and development. Finally, we propose a predictive framework for city planners aimed at enhancing UHI resilience by optimizing the placement of green spaces and water features. This framework demonstrates a potential for reducing urban temperatures by up to 7% in targeted neighborhoods, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful environmental integration in urban design.",
